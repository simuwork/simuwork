## Purpose
Scripted pitch demo showcasing SimuWork's AI-powered job simulation platform for business presentations.

## What It Does
- **Automatic choreographed workflow**: Pre-scripted 2-minute Payment API debugging scenario
- **Visual narration**: Animated balloons appear automatically explaining what AI agents are doing
- **Multi-agent collaboration**: Shows Senior Dev, PM, Junior Dev, and Incident agents working together
- **Real-time simulation**: Code changes, test execution, team communication - all automated
- **Zero interaction required**: Click "Start Demo" and watch it run

## Key Features for Pitch
1. **Professional UI**: Looks like fully functional interactive platform
2. **Automatic narration**: Balloons explain "The Senior Engineer AI is analyzing code..." as demo runs
3. **Complete workflow**: Problem detection → Investigation → Code fix → Testing → Completion
4. **Verified credentials**: Shows students earning employer-recognized credentials at end

## Technical Approach
